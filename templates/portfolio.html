                <p>
                    Work with Sunderland AFC to produce match predictions and season simultions, allowing the
                    leadership team to effectively monitor performance beyond simple league position.
                </p>

                    This also included analysing over 10,000 managers for the club to identify the best candidates, 
                    culminating in the appointment of Alex Neil, and promotion to the Championship. This was followed up
                    with the appointment of Tony Mowbray when Alex Neil left for Stoke City. Mowbray guided the club to
                    the Premier League playoffs, despite only being promoted that year.

                    An app I made for my mum when I ran out of ideas for birthday presents. I thought it would be simple. 
                    It wasn't.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This app contains information on all of the birds in the UK, including their appearance, diet, habitat,
                    and a recording of their call. It also includes a quiz to test your knowledge of bird sounds. There is 
                    even a cheeky bird image classifier, to pretend that I know something about machine learning.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you have an iPhone, please don't download this app. It is a waste of memory, and will just make you 
                    unhappy. 5 stars.
