        Hello everyone!
    <p>
        In between each paragraph, just use those p tags.
        I like writing one sentence per line here.
        But it will all just come out as one paragraph.
    <p>
        You get used to writing inbetween the tags, and just ignoring them.
        It's so much easier than using a collection of other tools to make HTML.
        Just write inside an HTML file directly!
        So much simpler.
    <p>
        You can <a href="templates/about_me.html">link to other pages like this</a>.
    <p>
    <p>
        <a href="templates/game.html">Game</a>
    <p>
        Or insert an image like this:
        <img src="https://sive.rs/images/kids-raft.jpg">
    <p>
        That's it!
